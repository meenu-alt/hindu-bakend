					<p>Always stay in control when it comes to how and when you share information. Take things slowly and share more information when you feel comfortable doing so. It is impossible to get back information once you have given it away.</p>
					<p>Be careful when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others can't view or record your password or personal information. Be wary of opening email attachments from someone you have only just met. Ensure that you keep your internet security software up to date.</p>
					<p>Stop communicating with anyone who attempts to pressure you into providing your personal or financial information or who seems to be trying to trick you into providing it. If this happens contact the service provider immediately to not only protect yourself but other users too. Remember that overtly sexual, provocative or controversial chat could attract the wrong kind of attention.</p>
					<p>Get to know people, take your time and trust your instincts. Act with caution and learn more about someone before contacting him or her outside of the website. Chat so you can get to know people in a safer and controlled way. Websites do it to protect you, not to make money. Use the website platform and the added security it gives.</p>
					<p>There is a limit to an online matrimonial provider’s ability to check the backgrounds of users and verify the information they provide. They cannot do a check on every user for any criminal activities. And a person can become a problem without having a record. Therefore, don't get a false sense of security because you're on a website; do your own research to learn more about someone and make informed decisions before you decide to meet. Check to see if the person you're interested in is on other social networking sites, do a web search to see if there are other records of the person online, and if possible, use image search to check the profile photos.</p>
					<p>There is no reason for anyone to ask you for money or your financial information, whatever sad story they tell you. Always keep your bank and account information private. Stop all contact immediately and report the matter to the website. Trust your instincts and immediately stop communicating with anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable. Never feel embarrassed to report a problem to the website service provider. You are helping them and other users.</p>
					<p>If you suspect that someone you are talking to may be a scammer, stop your communications and immediately report him/ her. You should never feel ashamed to report someone. Don’t be afraid to ask a friend or relative. If you start to commit to a relationship online, if a person starts to feel strange and especially if he/her wants money. You might ask a friend or relative if you are not at a point where you think there is something to report. Be safe online.</p>
